This is a software-based simulation system that has been implemented and tested on Intel Core i3, 2.1 GHz CPU with 4GB RAM on Windows 8.1 operating system. Different programming languages, such as JavaScript, JSP, PHP, HTML, CSS, etc., are used to develop the software where a floor plan is designed using grid representation. 
To run this application in a Windows operating system, you need to install wamp/Xampp and copy the project file into your c drive wamp/www directory.
